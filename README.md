# SIMPLE CALENDAR

## How it works

You need to add in a text input the data attribute "data-date-component" and as parameter you need to add the modal id *(if you have many inputs you need to set different date-component names)*

`<input type="text" data-date-component="calendar">`

## How to run the project

You must have nodejs V12.18.4 or last

*To run on development*

`npm run dev`

*To build for production*

`npm run build`
